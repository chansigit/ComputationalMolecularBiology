# ComputationalMolecularBiology
This is the homework of Computational Molecular Biology of DA,THU
This program implements global sequence alignment (needlemanâ€“wunsch algorithm)
and local sequence alignment (smith-waterman algorithm).

For global alignment, this program computes the DP matrix, gives the optimal
score (F[m][n]) and reconstruct the alignment sequence by backtrack.

For local alignment, this program computes the DP matrix, determines the maximum
value in the matrix, and reconstruct the alignment sequence from the position having the maximum value.
